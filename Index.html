    <h1>Think Global</h1>
    <h3>The core values of Think Global are respect, acceptance, and appreciation 
        of the cultural diversity that exists in the world. Think Global envisions 
        a world where everyone is free to have their own convictions and accepts that 
        others have the right to live in peace, regardless of the diversity of their 
        beliefs, identity or way of life.</h3>
    <h3>Think Global recognizes that intolerance stems from ignorance and fear of 
        different cultures, nations, or religions. Thus, Think Global provides exchange 
        programs that contribute to the understanding and learning of societies with a 
        different culture, religion, political, or economic system.</h3>
